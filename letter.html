<h1>For You 💖</h1>
<p>It’s going to be 6 months to us being together.  
I know I promised I will be a bit less crazier by the end of this, but I think with the way that you are, it's hard to lose the passion and the intensity.</p>  

<p>Your laugh is my favorite thing in the world. I love the way your eyes sparkle when you talk about the things you love.  I love your adorable dance when you eat something good.  
I love your beautiful eyes, and the sound of your laughter is without a doubt my favorite sound in the world.  </p>

<p>I keep asking you how you are so beautiful, but truth be told, I know the reason. It’s the purity of your heart that reflects on your face.  
</p>

<p>Please always be just the way you are, ecause the way you are is absolutely perfect.</p>
